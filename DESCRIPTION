Title: Gaussian graphical models with the tailored graphical lasso
Description: The tailored graphical lasso is an extension of the weighted graphical lasso for graph reconstruction. 
        The objective is to get better utilisation of the available prior information, while ensuring that the introduction of prior information may 
        not decrease the accuracy of the resulting inferred graph. The method takes a data matrix (or a covariance matrix) for which a weighted graphical
        lasso graph is to be inferred, and a prior weight matrix, and transformes the prior weights to more appropriate values with the logistic function.
